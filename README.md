I am currently at [Snowflake AI Research](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/ai/ai-research/), where I lead the development of [Arctic Inference](https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference). My research interests lie broadly in efficient ML systems, algorithms, and architectures. Previously, I served as the CEO of [Petuum](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/october/petuum-funding.html) and received my PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was supervised by [Eric Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/).

Before getting into ML systems, I studied Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo, where I worked on [improving Quicksort](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~skushagr/multipivotQuicksort.pdf) with [J. Ian Munro](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~imunro/) and [Alejandro Lopez-Ortiz](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/people-profiles/alejandro-alex-lopez-ortiz). I also participated in competitive programming, and won a [gold medal](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/303) at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
